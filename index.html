When we go on holidays to different places like hill stations, desert areas, river banks or the countryside, I always take my art material with me. I like to sit and paint a scenery as I watch it. The painting then is very vivid and comes alive. I find my hobby refreshing to me. I keep all my paintings carefully. I have participated in different art exhibitions and painting competitions at school and at state level events, and won prizes too.</p>

                <p id="para">What to speak about this stimulating hobby? Traveling is another pastime which compels me to stopover a new place, city, beach, village or mountain. It is consequently exciting to observe a new place and convene various types of citizens. Traveling allows me to employ my talent in photography. I always keep camera with me whenever I trip to a newer place and then I prefer capturing the photo-shots of buildings, people, marketplaces, and shrines of that place. In this way, I wisely spend my leisure time.</p>

I used to play chess and table tennis. I had the unique distinction of winning the chess championship at the school, district and state levels. I was taught the basics of chess by my father who used to be the happiest person when I used to win.</p>
